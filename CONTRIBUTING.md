## Adding Algorithms & Data Structures

Create a file with the algorithm and place it in the folder corresponding to the programming language used. Feel free to add a new folder if it does not exist already.

Update the README.md file with the link of your file under the appropriate category.

Please be sure to follow the guidelines below 👇

### 📁 File names

Name the file with the name of the algorithm. Use all **lowercase** characters with the words separated by a hyphen (-).

For example, if the name of your algorithm is _My Awesome Algorithm_, the file should be named as `my-awesome-algorithm.<ext>` where `<ext>` is the extension of the file.

### 📄 Updating README.md

Add the relative link to your file to the list under the corresponding language heading.
**The list is arranged in alphabetical order.**

For example, for adding `my-awesome-algorithm.<ext>`, the list item will be

```
- [My Awesome Algorithm](language-folder/my-awesome-algorithm.<ext>)
```

The first _letter_ of each word in the link title should be in uppercase.

If the language heading does not exist already then add a new heading in such a way that the headings remain in alphabetical order.

Create a Pull Request after commiting the changes.

Thank you in advance for your contribution 😊
